# GPaint

GPaint is a theme editor for [Geany themes](https://www.geany.org/download/themes/). It allows you to adjust and manipulate the colors of a theme with contrast, saturation and more.

# Requirements and how to use

## Requirements
* Java 11 or newer

## Download and run

Grab the latest release of Geany from the [releases page](https://github.com/spacebanana420/gpaint/releases) and run the JAR with ´java -jar´. Run ´java -jar gpaint.jar -h´ to see what you can do.

# Build from source

GPaint uses the [Yuuka build tool](https://github.com/spacebanana420/yuuka).

You can build an executable JAR with `yuuka package`.

## Install GPaint (Unix-like systems)

Run **as root**: `yuuka install`.

If you are on FreeBSD or you have `~/.local/bin` in your $PATH, you do not have to run Yuuka as root to install GPaint.
